Things we need to resolve

1.) Indexing of sources so that we can keep track of sources across different levels of resolution
This is because we want to use the same source for each level


2.) Since we are trimming the epsilon covers at each level, it is particularly important with a good
indexing scheme for keeping track of nodes.

3.) We need to find a way to weight the source index now that we have decided to not use 
a region source, but instead use a point source with weight.
- TO weight by the density dont work
- My suggestion is to weight with the number of samples inside epsilon ball, but not divide by number
of other nodes in epsilon cover. This way we dont consider the density per say. This strategy did seem to work
better with the initial experiments, in terms of approximating the voltage distribution over the
actual density.
